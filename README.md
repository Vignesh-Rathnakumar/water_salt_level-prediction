# 💧 Water Salt Level Prediction App

This project predicts **water salt levels** using physical and chemical properties of water samples.  
It uses a **Machine Learning model (Random Forest)** and a **Streamlit web app** for visualization.

---

## 🧠 Features
- Predict salt level in mg/L
- Classifies water as **Drinkable** or **Not Drinkable**
- Interactive dashboard with graphs and gauge indicators
